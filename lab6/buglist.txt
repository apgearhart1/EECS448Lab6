1. PeekFront() does not work properly, behaves like a getTop() for a stack.
2. Dequeue() or the Queue Destructor does not appear to totally destroy the queue nodes because there are memory leaks.
3. Dequeue() does not return value of what is being dequeued
4. Dequeue() does not return a runtime error for if there is nothing to dequeue.
